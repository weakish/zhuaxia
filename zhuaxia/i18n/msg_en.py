    [CONFIG FILE:]  $HOME/.zhuaxia/zhuaxia.conf
                    It will be automatically created when zhuaxia was started first time.

    [OPTIONS]
        -H : prefer High Quality(320kbps),
            > xiami <
                - xiami vip user email/password should be set in config
                - user should set HQ on xiami vip setting page
                - if any above requirements was not satisfied, 128kbps will be taken
            > 163 <
                - no special requirement

        -h : show this help

        -m : (NetEase only) does not write ID3 tags to file, instead write meta data to ~/.zhuaxia/zhuxia.db

        -l : download lyric too (lrc format)

        -f : download from url file (see example in [USAGE])

        -i : incremental downloading
             zhuaxia will check download history and skip the mp3 if it has been downloaded before.
             To identify a downloaded mp3, the combination of these three attributes will be checked:
             song_id(id in xiami/netease), source (xiami/netease), quality (H/L)

        -e : export history data to file, if this option was given, other options will be ignored.

        -d : clear all history data, if this option was given, other options will be ignored.
             -e and -d cannot be used together.

        -v : show version information

        -p : auto choose proxy from proxy pool (experimental option)
             when frequency of request to target host is high enough, host could ban the client
             for some time. zhuaxia will auto take proxy from pool. However this may make
             downloading slow or unstable.
